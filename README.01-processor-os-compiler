It has been suggested as a new convention to name binary distributions
something like

    package-version-bin-binversion-processor-os-compiler

with the "-bin-" part being verbatim.

The existence of binary packages also implicates that there's a need
for specific README files for the port. Maybe we should give such
README files names that mimic the name of the distribution file?
We could append everything after "-bin-" after a dot, e.g.

    README.01-processor-os-compiler

It's just a suggestion. _This_ README file is just a test if PAUSE
is programmed to support this suggestion or not.
